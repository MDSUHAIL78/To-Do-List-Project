# To-Do-List-Project
A to-do list is a simple web application that allows users to create a list of tasks they need to accomplish. It typically includes a form for adding new tasks, a list to display existing tasks, and buttons to mark tasks as complete or delete them.

A to-do list project typically involves creating a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML provides the structure and layout of the page, the CSS provides the visual styling and design, and the JavaScript provides interactivity and dynamic behavior.

The main features of a to-do list application include:

     Adding new tasks to the list
     Marking tasks as complete
     Deleting tasks
Persisting tasks, so that they are not lost when the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.
